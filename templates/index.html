  <h3> The App </h3>

    Hackathon</a> run by <a href="https://coinsecure.in">Coinsecure</a>, an
    Indian Bitcoin exchange. The app uses
    the <a href="https://api.coinsecureis.cool/">Coinsecure API</a> to build
    useful reporting for frequent traders on the Coinsecure portal. The source
    code powering this app is open sourced under the Affero GPL,
    and <a href="https://github.com/skarra/coinsecure-cg">available on
